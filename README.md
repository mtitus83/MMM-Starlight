## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the MagicMirror logs for any error messages.
2. Ensure that your `config.js` file is correctly formatted and the module configuration is correct.
3. Verify that you have an active internet connection, as the module needs to fetch horoscope data online.
4. If the scrolling doesn't work, make sure the horoscope text is longer than the `maxTextHeight` value.
